## Work

I am a PhD Candidate in Natural Language Processing at the [LiLPa research unit (UR 1339)](https://lilpa.unistra.fr/), affiliated with the [University of Strasbourg](https://unistra.fr/). I am working on LLM gender bias mitigation for French.

My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, digital humanities and linguistics. I am particularly interested in the ethical and social implications of LLMs, and I am also following advancements in other subfields of generative AI fairness, such as explainability as well as evaluation and mitigation of other types of biases.

As part of my PhD, I am also [giving lectures and tutorials](/academia) at the [University of Strasbourg](https://unistra.fr/).

Before that, I have worked since 2016 as a freelance English-to-French localization specialist for eminent video game companies and indie developers, such as [Valve Corporation](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) (_Steam_, _Dota 2_, _Counter-Strike 2_, _Deadlock_) or [Daniel Mullins](https://www.danielmullinsgames.com/) (_Inscryption_, _The Hex_). While I loved doing localization work, I have had to drastically reduce my workload since October 2024 to give priority to my PhD and other academic activities.

## Personal

As a curiosity-driven person, learning and research is never very far away from my mind, even in my spare time. I take great pleasure in reading about a wide range of topics on the Internet or in books, and filling my knowledge management system with these new thoughts and ideas. In this process, I often reflect on the works of [gwern](https://gwern.net/) and [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/), whose pieces of writing and passion for research have inspired me to tread a similar path by pursuing a career in academia and fueling my own desire to share and contribute to the advancement of knowledge.

In particular, my interests (other than computer science and linguistics, both of them being directly related to my research) primarily revolve around languages, philosophy, psychology, and politics. I sometimes publish my thoughts on these topics as [writings](/writings).

When it comes to computer science, I am eager to applying my newly acquired knowledge to [open-source personal projects](/projects).

Among the other things I am interested in are [photography](/photography) and UI/UX design. I also enjoy hiking and traveling (who doesn't?).

My favorite music genres are alternative rock, chillhop, city pop, indie/dream pop, French house, future funk and synthwave. Some of my favorite artists and bands are Daft Punk, Desired, Lana Del Rey, Mazzy Star, Men I Trust, Muse and Yung Bae.
